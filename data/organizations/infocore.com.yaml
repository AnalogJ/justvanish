    Allows Opt-Out? No
    Infocore Inc. is a broker only and as such does not collect, aggregate, nor own any data. We are solely the company that puts together a rental or license agreement between an end-user marketer with a data collector/aggregator/owner. We do not sell any data. It is analogous to the real estate industry where we act as the intermediary between the two companies.  We do not have access to personally identifiable data and as such are not able to provide the ability for consumers to opt-out of data.
