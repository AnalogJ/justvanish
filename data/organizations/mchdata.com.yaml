    MCH Strategic Data is a 90-year-old family business that specializes in business to business data compilation for the market segments of education, healthcare, church and government work address contact information.  MCH does not make a practice of compiling personal information on individuals beyond their job titles and work department-level information.  Personally descriptive information (age, income, etc)  is "not" found in MCH databases.
    Allows Opt-Out? Yes - by email
    A person may request via our website links or via an email to us or a phone call to our 800 number and provide us the information we need to remove them from our lists.  We maintain the opt-out list and use that data to make sure the individual does not get added back into the list at a later data through future compilation processes
    Our focus is 95% business to business contact information and therefore not subject to this process.  But for the 5% that we do have personal "home based" information that is accessed we wanted to register to be in compliance.
    by email and phone
