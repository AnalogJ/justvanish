    We are a Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA) that provides background checks for employment-related purposes. Our services are opt-in only. Consumers must provide written authorization before we begin to compile a background check. A consumer may withdraw their consent or review the information we have on file and request that we delete it at any time. We do not maintain a database of information. Our data is stored for a period of time that complies with FCRA regulations.
    We only produce consumer reports for FCRA-approved purposes. The data we receive is exclusively used for the purpose of creating a consumer report that has been authorized, in writing, by the consumer. This data is never re-sold to any third party.
