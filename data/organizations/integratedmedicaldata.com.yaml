    The footer on our website includes a link to Alerts.com, a CCPA compliance service, in which the consumer can search what information we have and opt out of the database.  Those opts outs are added to a global suppression file that is then omitted from future list sales.
    Alerts.com allows the deletion request to be submitted directly on the website, which provides a time/date and IP address stamp.  The individual then receives a notification of their request, referring to the time and date it was received.
    IMD is a list broker, we do not compile or aggregate data.  We are contracted to purchased data on behalf of our clients.
