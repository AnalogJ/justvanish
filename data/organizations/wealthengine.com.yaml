    WealthEngine does not have actual knowledge that it possesses the brokered personal information of minors (as the date of birth cannot be verified). WealthEngine identified data that potentially could be of individuals under the age of 18, so WealthEngine out of abundance of caution is taking ongoing measures to remove such data from its products and services.
