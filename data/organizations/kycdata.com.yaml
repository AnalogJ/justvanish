    KYC Data is a compiler of mortgages and deeds.  The names, addresses, mortgage amount and sales price information is sold for both marketing and research purposes.  More specific information is available on our web site at: https://www.kycdata.com/for-consumers/, , We do not track information as a consumer moves from point a to point b.  We do not compile other personal information., , We do have the ability to merge our deed (mortgages and warranty deeds) data with large data providers to provide more discrete targeting., , We have arranged with our aggregator partners (customers who purchase our data for resell and merge with other consumer data), the ability to periodically send them opt out and delete requests., , Note, KYC Data does purchases data from a third party in the state of California; we do not compile that information ourselves.  This is unlike our normal operations where we hire individuals and companies to either physically enter the court house, or log on to a system to compile the data.
