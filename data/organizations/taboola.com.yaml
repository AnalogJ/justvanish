Please note that this feature is currently only available for California state residents. Individuals that do not reside in California may visit Taboola's Data Subject Access Request Portal, which is available at https://accessrequest.taboola.com.\nCalifornia consumers may request that Taboola delete any personal information that we hold about you via Taboola's Data Subject Access Request Portal, which is available at https://accessrequest.taboola.com.\nTaboola provides consumers with personalized content and advertisements across thousands of global digital properties. To do so, Taboola maintains pseudonymous data about consumers, which means that we do not know the consumer’s identity because we do not process names, email address, or other identifiable data. Instead, we only process digital identifiers such as cookie IDs, IP addresses, and mobile advertising IDs from the consumer's device (for a full list of the pseudonymized data that we process, please see Taboola's Privacy Policy, available at https://www.taboola.com/privacy-policy). , , Taboola may disclose or make available consumers' pseudonymous data to our trusted partners. In most cases when we do so, we have contractually restricted their uses of this data for only Taboola’s business purposes. Under the CCPA, such disclosures of Personal Information to service providers are not deemed to be a “sale” and thus are not prohibited after a consumer exercises his or her right to cease or restrict disclosures or sales of data. In any instances where we have not entered into a service provider relationship with a third party company, we will stop sharing the consumer's data when instructed to not “sell” the personal information., "
