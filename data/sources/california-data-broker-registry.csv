California law broadly defines what constitutes a “sale” – including in the definition making available a wide variety of information in exchange for “valuable consideration.”, , If you would like to opt out, you may follow the link at the bottom of our website or click here: “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” or email us at info@HealthWiseData.com. The “opt-out” action effectively removes all information from our files, and places your information on a “suppression” list. We will only retain enough to ensure your information is not reintroduced., , California residents have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information that we collect, use, or sell. You may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you. However, we may withhold some personal information where the risk to you or our business is too great to disclose the information. Sometimes, we act only as a “service provider” to our clients (for instance, if they provide information to us for analytics, processing, or other data management services), in which case any consumer requests for opt-out, deletion, or access to data must be made through that client: we therefore will forward any such requests to a named client, as feasible., , California residents may exercise their California access rights by going to our Privacy Portal within the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” page or email us at info@HealthWiseData.com. For security purposes (and as required under California law), we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you — when you request to exercise your California access rights. For instance, you may need to confirm your possession of an identifier, identifying information, or to provide a piece of identification that confirms you are the person you claim to be.","You may also request that we “delete” any personal information that we collected directly from you, such as if you are a customer of ours, or interacted with us at a trade show. California residents may exercise their California deletion rights by going to our Privacy Portal within the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” page or email us at info@HealthWiseData.com. However, ‘deletion” is different from “opting out” of sale (or exercising your “do not sell” rights), as it only pertains to information we collected “from” you – not the data in our commercial database. Thus, if you want to avoid being placed in our database in the future, and avoid having your data “sold” to marketers, then you should exercise your “opt out” rights, described in section A above and on our “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” page: we will then maintain your information on a suppression list, to “suppress” your data if we later acquire it., , Also note that when we “delete” your information (e.g., if you are a former customer of ours), we may (and are permitted to) retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to ensure your deleted information is not reintroduced to our systems, (b) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (c) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as debugging purposes), (d) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (e) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (f) for scientific or historical research, (g) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.","Depending on how you interact with us, we may collect about you the categories of information summarized in a table in section 1 of the CCPA Addendum to the privacy statement on our website (https://www.healthwisedata.com/privacy., , ,  , ","02/14/2022"
